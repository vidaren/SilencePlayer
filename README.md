# SilencePlayer
## What it is
SilencePlayer is an application for MacOS that will play silence continuously. This may not sound useful, but it has one purpose: Keep the audio equipment in and outside your Mac primed and active.
SilencePlayer was developed for a specific use case: A NAD T 747 AV amplifier connected to the optical output of a Mac. The NAD amp will shut down its audio processing when the Mac is not sending audio. This results in a noticable delay before anything can be heard when audio is again sent from the Mac. The pause between songs on a Spotify playlist is enough for the NAD to shut down / fire up between tracks, making for an unpleasant listening experience. With SilencePlayer running alongside Spotify, these problems with the NAD go away.
Hopefully, SilencePlayer can solve similar situations with other audio gear.
